# 🌡️ UTFVI-Based Urban Heat Analysis of Bursa City

This project investigates **Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI)** as a method to assess thermal stress and urban heat island phenomena in Bursa, Türkiye. UTFVI is a quantitative index that measures surface heat variation relative to the average land surface temperature (LST), offering insight into ecological pressure and human thermal discomfort in urban environments.

## 🔍 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Extract the seasonal variations in average Land Surface Temperature (LST) across the districts of Bursa City
- Identify UTFVI hotspots across different districts of Bursa City
- Examine the seasonal variations in ecological conditions within those districts

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) (via `grass.jupyter` and scripting interface)
- Landsat-8/9 Satellite Imagery
- Raster & Vector GIS Processing
