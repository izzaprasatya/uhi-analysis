# 🌡️ UTFVI-Based Urban Heat Analysis of Bursa City

This project investigates **Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI)** as a method to assess thermal stress and urban heat island phenomena in Bursa, Turkey. UTFVI is a quantitative index that measures surface heat variation relative to the average land surface temperature (LST), offering insight into ecological pressure and human thermal discomfort in urban environments.

## 🔍 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Identify UTFVI hotspots in different districts of Bursa
- Analyze seasonal variations (winter and summer)
- Examine correlations between UTFVI and:
  - Land Surface Temperature (LST)
  - Vegetation proportion (Pv)
  - Land cover types
  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) (via `grass.jupyter` and scripting interface)
- Landsat-8/9 Satellite Imagery
- Raster & Vector GIS Processing
